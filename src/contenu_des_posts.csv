I'll paste below:\n\xa0\nNew devices come with 3 sims so you can choose the size which fits your phone\n\xa0\nA SIM card is sent with the 3 size option: Standard, Micro and Nano SIM. You just need to break out what size you require. It is detailed on the card what area you need to break out for what size. A recommendation is to do it carefully as breaking out the Nano when a Mirco SIM is needed will require a whole new SIM to be sent.\n\xa0\nIs the sim blank or does it have a temporary number attached?\xa0\n\xa0\nThere is no number attached to a replacement Pay Monthly SIM card, it is blank.\n\xa0\nFinally the question we are always being asked is, do I do the swap from my old sim or the new one?\xa0\n\xa0\nIf texting\xa0'Swap' to\xa020220 to activate the SIM this needs to be sent from the old SIM only, the new SIM won‚Äôt be active to enable this.\n\xa0\nSIM swaps can now also be actioned via your My O2 app. You‚Äôll find an option under ‚ÄòManage your account‚Äô of ‚ÄòSwap your SIM‚Äô. You‚Äôll need to re-enter your My O2 username and password, you‚Äôll then be sent a verification code via text to your phone. Once this has been confirmed you can enter your new SIM info and this will be swapped within 24hrs.\n\xa0\nAs mentioned above you can also text ‚ÄòSwap‚Äô to 20220 to activate it.\n\xa0\nIf you don‚Äôt have an active SIM to do either of the above to you‚Äôll need to call customer services to activate it.

Pay monthly vs Pay as you go,"['\nHi, I‚Äôm currently with Three and looking to move over to o2, I got myself a pay as you go sim to try out the network, and I must say, compared to Three I find the coverage to be completely awful..I live in the Surrey Hills, o2 says at my home postcode I should get full coverage of 2G, 4G and 4G calling and low 3G coverage! But in reality I only get 3G and 2G both inside and outside, which to be honest isn‚Äôt a real issue as I have Wi-Fi so would use that and Wi-Fi calling if needed.But what I‚Äôm most surprised about is the general coverage I have found using the o2 pay as you go sim, I stream internet radio when In my car and I work 31 miles away in Twickenham, Three performs pretty well, I got maybe 2 or 3 places that the internet radio stops working, however with o2 it does it at least 20 times or more! I‚Äôm surprised with such an established network that it performs so poorly! Does pay as you go have access to all the same frequencies as pay monthly, obviously without 5G?\xa0I wanted to move to o2 for the free roaming, plus they offer esim and visual voicemail which Three don‚Äôt.. Maybe I‚Äôll have to stay with Three!\xa0\n', ""\nI completely agree with youDon't make a choice you'll regretWell done for trying PAYG first\n\nO2 Social Media(Twitter | Instagram | Facebook)\n\n"", '\nNo free roaming and eSIM but 5G, WiFi Calling and Visual Voicemail are standard on Voxi (Vodafone)\xa0\n']"
